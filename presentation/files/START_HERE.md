## 🎪 Your Killer Feature: Epic Bard Style

**This is what judges will remember.**

When you demonstrate the Epic Bard style in your video:
1. Show the boring original: "Team fixed login bug"
2. Then dramatically read the Epic version with emphasis
3. Make it theatrical - this is entertainment
4. Show the `05_recap_styles.png` diagram while you do it

**Example you can use**:
> "Previously on the Engineering Quest...
> 
> In the sacred halls of the Development Fellowship, a grave matter was brought forth. The dreaded Login Beast, long thought dormant, had risen once more to plague the realm. Lady Sarah, Keeper of the Backend Code, took oath to vanquish this foe before the fifth dawn..."

If judges are choosing between similar projects, **they'll pick the one that made them smile and think "I want to show this to my team."**
